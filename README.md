# ravencoin-sign-transaction
Signs a Ravencoin transaction

The sole purpose of this project is to enable us to
"Sign RVN or asset transfer transactions in pure JavaScript"

## What we need

We need code that can take the UNSIGNED transaction, and sign it using the private keys.

[decoded UNSIGNED transaction](./mock/decodedUnsignedTransaction.json)

[decoded SIGNED transaction](./mock/decodedSignedTransaction.json)

[Private keys](./mock/privateKeys.json)
